<b>POI Submission Rules and Guidelines:</b>
<ul>
<li>Submissions must be in English.<br/><br/></li>

<li>Any submissions containing profanity, explicit or offensive content will not be approved, and the submitter will be contacted for redress. Repeat offenses may result in banning from EDAstro.<br/><br/></li>

<li>DO NOT VIOLATE COPYRIGHTS. If you are using material (text, images, etc) that you didn't create, please cite and link to the source. If the owner has restricted use or duplication, then do not use it at all. <br/><br/></li>

<li>You will be notified if the system you are submitting has any GMP (Galactic Mapping Project) entries on EDSM, and a link to it will automatically be added to the GEC entry. <br/><br/></li>

<li>You will also be notified if the system you are submitting has any existing GEC POI's. Please review them before submitting yours and refrain from creating duplicate entries, or an excessive number of them, in a single system.<br/><br/></li>

<li>A screenshot of the POI is required. You can host your images at your service of choice, however please choose one that will permanently provide the images (not discord).<br/><br/></li>

<li>POI Names should be creative and unique, comply with <a href="/gec/tos">TOS rules</a>, and also fall loosely within <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_naming_conventions">International Astronomical Union</a> naming conventions or otherwise be poetic or interesting. As part of those conventions, names that are of a commercial nature, pop culture, or named after a living person are also discouraged. Entry names should not simply state what the POI consists of, and GEC Staff will approve POI names at their discretion.
<br/><br/></li>

<li>Latitude and Longitude are required for planetary surface locations.<br/><br/></li>

<li>Nebulae (planetary or otherwise) will only be approved if they are notable in additional ways.<br/><br/></li>

<li>Keep your descriptions and references within the Elite Dangerous universe. Avoid referring to "the game," "players," or making out-of-game references.<br/><br/></li>

<li>If you can, please include relevant entries from the game's journal files, or from Elite Observatory. This is not required but adds important details to your POI that are difficult to convey in a description.<br/><br/></li>
</ul>

The GEC team is dedicated to ensuring the accuracy, validity, and adherence to guidelines of every POI submission. However, we are unable to visit most of them and may miss the occasional detail. Also, conditions may change at a particular location that renders a POI inaccurate or invalid. If you come across a guideline violation, inaccuracy, or significant change in a POI, please report it using the "Report POI" button, and provide a brief description of the issue. Note that the button is not to be used to inform us of your opinion of the POI or its submitting Commander. Also note that the latter may be in violation of EDAstro terms of use.
