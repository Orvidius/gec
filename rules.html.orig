<p>
Welcome to the Galactic Exploration Catalog (GEC) on EDAstro! The following
is a set of rules, guidelines, and best practices. Please be sure to take
these things into account when creating POIs, and voting on them.
</p><p>
<b>Rules, Code of Conduct</b>
<ul>
<li><b>DO NOT VIOLATE COPYRIGHTS.</b> If you are using text that you did not write, please cite (and link) to the source. This includes the <a href="https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-galactic-mapping-project-historical-archive-of-exploration.116450/">GMP (Galactic Mapping Project)</a> on <a href="https://edsm.net">EDSM</a>. If the source material is under strict copyright, then please do not use it at all.<br/><br/></li>
<li>No harassing, intimidating, shaming, or insulting others.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Stay on topic. POI details should stick to descriptions relevant to that POI and exploration in Elite.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Submissions must be in English.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Avoid profanity.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Please refrain from creating excessively duplicate POIs. This can include adding POIs to star systems that already have them. The exception is when a POI needs to be replaced because the original submitter isn't available, and information needs to be changed.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Also, please do not spam us with lots of low quality submissions. Putting thought and effort into your entries will help them to stand out.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Nebulae and Planetary Nebulae should only be submitted here if they are notable in additional ways. They are common enough that we don't need POIs just because they are nebulae. They should be additionally interesting to be included as a POI. Otherwise, they should instead go to <A href="https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/catalogue-of-galactic-nebulae-submit-your-planetary-nebulae.511743/">The Catalogue of Galactic Nebulae</a>.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Please do not copy/paste entire POI entries from the Galactic Mapping Project as identical copies, unless you are also the original submitter, or have permission from the original submitter. Some locations are significant enough to warrant existing in both catalogs, so it will take some discretion to determine how much should be written from scratch. And of course, adding a clickable markdown link to the <a href="https://edsm.net">EDSM</a> / <a href="https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-galactic-mapping-project-historical-archive-of-exploration.116450/">GMP</a> entry is also possible.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Curators can and will remove POI submissions that do not adhere to these rules.<br/><br/></li>
</ul>
</p><p>
<b>What makes a good POI submission</b>
<ul>
<li>Should be of interest to other explorers.<br/><br/></li>
<li>A general rule of thumb is "Would I travel 20,000 lightyears to visit this?"<br/><br/></li>
<li>Use good grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Using a spellchecker would be a good idea.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Include details and information about why this location is interesting, or unique.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Optionally, include some pictures.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Try to include logs from programs such as Observatory, showing properties of the system or its bodies that might be relevant to explorers and curators.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Stay "within universe". Avoid referring to "the game", or "players", or out-of-universe details.<br/><br/></li>
</ul>
</p><p>
