</p><p>
The scoring system that the GEC uses may not be immediately obvious, but here is how it works. 
The explorer's score is a number from one to ten (1-10), which starts with the average number
of stars voted (1-5), and scales this number up to the larger range on a curve, taking the base-10 logarithm
(exponent) of the number of votes to use as the range multipler. This is meant to keep new POIs with
only one or two votes from immediately taking the top positions in any rankings, while earning
"higher score" by garnering additional votes, up to the maximum theoretical score of 10 points.
</p><p>
In practice, this means that the very first vote will be reflected directly, with a score of 1 to 5.
Once the POI has 10 votes, the score will be scaled half-way toward the maximum, in the range of
1 - 7.5, reflecting the increased confidence in the scores when more votes are included. Once the
POI has 100 or more votes, the range will reach its maximum of 1 to 10 points. At this scale, an
average vote of 3 stars across all votes will result in a score of 5.5. If all 100 votes are 1-star,
the score is 1. To reach a score of exactly 10, a POI must have 100 or more votes with <i><u>all of them</u></i>
being 5-star votes.
</p><p>
These scales are designed to reward POIs with "better" scores in general, as they receive more
votes and confidence in the rating increases. As long as the POI is getting voted with 3 or more
stars more frequently than 1 or 2, the score will tend to increase until there are a few tens
of votes, where it will gradually stabilize.
</p><p>
A minimum rating of 3 points is needed to be included in the interactive map. New POIs will need
an average vote of 3 stars or more in order to hit this threshold, whereas established POIs with
100 votes would only need an average vote of 2 or more stars.
</p><p>
As with everything in this project, this is subject to change, should there be enough interest
or sufficient reason to do so. However hopefully this will help explain why the numbers increase
beyond 5, and how they are determined.
