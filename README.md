# GEC
Code for the Galactic Exploration Catalog project on EDAstro.com

This repo exists as a backup in case anything ever happens to Orvidius, thus making it at least possible to restore GEC functionality somewhere else in the future.

NOTE: This code was never meant for human eyes. Attempt to understand it at your own peril. :)


Main code is in the script called "poi", with "poidev" being a testing/staging development copy.
