This system is one of many in the so-called "brown dwarf layer", which is dominated by low mass star systems that tend to contain brown dwarf stars only. However, *Synuefe WG-L a76-1* stands out because it contains something rarely seen in these dim and desolate places: an Earth-like World.

This world was likely formed in another star system, then flung out from there and later captured here. This assumption is based on the planet's high orbital inclination (170Â°) and eccentricity (0.238), and that it's much more massive and larger than the other planets.

Since the system contains only brown dwarf stars, this world receives little in the way of sunlight, and most of what it does get is in the infrared spectrum. As such, the surface of this planet appears to have a distinct red tint over the usual green and blue colours of Earth-like worlds. With an average surface temperature of only 262 K, this planet barely classifies as being habitable. Even this temperature is only reached thanks to the greenhouse effect of the water vapour in its atmosphere (0.67% water vapour, in a 0.63 atm surface pressure). However, most parts of the surface would be uninhabitable, due to the planet's synchronous rotation around its parent star, which looms large in its sky.

Although the class L main star of the system is brighter, and is only around 260 ls away, it still doesn't "contribute" much, because it's a brown dwarf star that wouldn't move much on the Earth-like world's sky. The third star of the system would be visible on the (near-)perpetual night side of the planet, but as it's a class T brown dwarf that's ~5,000 ls away, with an orbital period of nearly fifty years, little light from it reaches here.

As such, and with these surface temperatures, the polar ice caps are significantly larger than on average temperature Earth-like worlds. They extend far enough that there are entire islands surrounded by ice.

This system was colonized in 3311 August, as part of the Trailblazer Initiative. Even though it's relatively close to the core systems (only 343 ly from Sol), the nearest inhabited system was 45 ly away when a chain of outposts was built. The first thing built here was a criminal outpost.

The entrepreneurs who flocked here soon found value in the hardy vegetation of the planet, and with a Coriolis station in orbit, the colony was built out to focus on agriculture and research. With a lack of commodity regulation though, all manners of goods can be purchased here, even ones which are considered illegal in most jurisdictions.
